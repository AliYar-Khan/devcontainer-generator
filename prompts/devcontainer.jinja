Given the following context from a GitHub repository:

{{ repo_context }}

Generate a devcontainer.json file for this project. The file should include appropriate settings for the development environment based on the project's requirements and structure. The 'features' field is essential and should include a dictionary of features to enable within the container.

Here's an example of a devcontainer.json with the 'features' field:
```json
{
    "name": "Example Dev Container",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.12-bookworm",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node": {
            "version": "latest"
        }
    },
    "forwardPorts": [3000],
    "postCreateCommand": "npm install"
}
